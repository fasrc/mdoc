Summary: A number of options for transferring data to and from research computing facilities.


There are different ways in which to transfer data to and from research computing facilities. The appropriate choice will depend on the size of your data, your need to secure it and also who you wish to share it with. 

### To copy the data to or from a location for yourself (or a collaborator who has a Research Computing account)

Within Harvard or when connected over the VPN you can [mount your file system on your desktop or laptop to copy data securely](/access-and-login.html#mounting-odyssey-storage-like-home-directories-and-lab-shares-on-your-desktop). We can publish your data on a web server which uses your (and your collaborator's) research computing credentials to give you access. 

### When sending data to a collaborator without an account on research computing systems

For files (or folders) under 20GB in size that need to be sent to individuals please use the [Accellion secure file transfer](https://fta.fas.harvard.edu). 

For unsecured publishing of data on the web contact rchelp@fas.harvard.edu. This will make your data available (readable to the world) over a URL. For large amounts of data you may request research computing to receive or ship USB drives to transfer your data. Â  Please contact [rchelp](rchelp>) if your needs fall outside these directions.
