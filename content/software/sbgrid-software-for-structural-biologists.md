Summary: Using the SBGrid software on Odyssey

###Introduction
The [SBGrid Consortium](https://sbgrid.org/) makes available to its members for a fee a suite of software programs, both open source and commercial, for its structural biology members. These programs are now available on Odyssey and are available for SBGrid members to use for HPC/HTC computations. If you are not yet a member and would like to use this software, please contact the [SBGrid team](https://sbgrid.org/join/).

###Accessing the Software
To access the software, you must be a paying member of the SBGrid consortium. Submit a ticket to [RCHelp](https://portal.rc.fas.harvard.edu) requesting access. Once we verify with SBGrid support that your lab is a paying member, we will add you to the appropriate Odyssey group to access the software.

###Using the Software
Once you've logged in to Odyssey, enter

    :::bash
    source /n/sw/sbgrid/programs/sbgrid.shrc

and the SGBrid programs will be put in your `$PATH`

###Suport
Support from the SBGrid staff is a part of your membership fee. Please direct all question about SBGrid software to their [support form](https://sbgrid.org/help/?tab=contact-us).
