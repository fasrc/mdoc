Summary: Avoid reentering two-factor authentication code when using multiple terminals.

OpenSSH has an option called `ControlMaster` that enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single network connection. This means that you can connect to Odyssey once, enter your password and Verification code, and have all other subsequent `ssh` sessions (including `svn`, `rsync`, etc. that run over `ssh`) piggy-back off the initial connection without need for re-authentication. You can specify such options each time on the command line, but it's easiest if you put it in your `ssh` client configuration file so that it applies every time. 

On your Mac or linux desktop or laptop, create a text file `~/.ssh/config` with, for example, the following contents:

    Host ody
    User myusername
    HostName login.rc.fas.harvard.edu
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/%r@%h:%p

where `myusername` is replaced appropriately. This sets things up so that whenever you ssh to the host nickname `ody`: `ssh ody` 

It will look for the special file (a socket) in your `~/.ssh/` directory that is maintaining a connection to Odyssey. If it already exists and is open, it'll use it to create a connection without re-authenticating; if it doesn't exist, it'll authenticate and create the file for subsequent use. 

Note that all subsequent connections are dependent on the initial connection â€” if you exit or kill the initial connection _all_ other ones die, too. This can obviously be annoying if it happens accidentally. It's easily avoided by setting up a master connection in the background:

    :::bash
    ssh -Y -C -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -fN ody

The `-fN` make it go into the background and sit idle, after authenticating. (`-Y` for X fowarding, `-C` for compression, and `-o ServerAliveInterval=30` to prevent dropped connections have nothing to do with the `ControlMaster` but are almost always helpful.) 

Note that all port fowarding, including X display forwarding, must be setup by the initial connection and cannot be changed. For example, if you set up a master connection when sitting at your desktop, and then later `ssh` to the desktop itself and use that ody connection, X programs that you run will open on the desktop's display, not the display of the computer you're now connecting to the desktop from. Likewise, if you forget to use `-X` or `-Y` on the initial connection, you will not be able to open X programs on subsequent connections.
